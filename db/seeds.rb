# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
messages = Message.create([
    {
      greeting: 'Hi are you well?'
    },
   {
      greeting: 'We greet you'
    },
    {
      greeting: 'Nice to have you'
    },
    {
      greeting: 'Today is great day'
    },
    {
      greeting: 'Hesi sha'
    },
    {
      greeting: 'Mhoroi'
    }
  ])
